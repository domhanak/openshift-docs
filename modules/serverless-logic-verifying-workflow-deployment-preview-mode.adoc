= Verifying workflow deployment

You can verify that your {ServerlessLogicProductName} workflow is running by performing a test HTTP call from the workflow pod.
 
.Prerequisites

* You have an {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} installed on your cluster.
* You have access to an {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI `(oc)`.
* You have deployed your workflow in preview mode in the {ocp-product-title}.

.Procedure

. Retrieve the list of service and identify the one matching `name` of your workflow:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get svc -n <namespace>
----

. Create a route for the workflow service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc expose svc/<workflow-service-name> -n <namespace>
----
+
This command creates a public URL to access the workflow service.

. Set an environment variable for the public URL by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ WORKFLOW_SVC=$(oc get route/<workflow-service-name> -n <namespace> --template='{{.spec.host}}')
----

. Make an HTTP call to the workflow to send a POST request to the service by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -d '{<"your": "json_payload">}' http://$WORKFLOW_SVC/<endpoint>
----
+
.Example output
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "b5fbfaa3-b125-4e6c-9311-fe5a3577efdd",
  "workflowdata": {
    "name": "John",
    "language": "English",
    "greeting": "Hello from JSON Workflow, "
  }
}
----

This output shows an example of the expected response if the workflow is running.
